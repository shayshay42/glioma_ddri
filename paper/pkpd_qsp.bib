	abstract = {Computational models can be applied to optimize treatment schedules and model treatment responses in cancer therapy. In this Review, we provide an overview of such computational approaches, including deterministic models, such as those based on ordinary and partial differential equations, stochastic models, spatially explicit agent-based approaches as well as control theory and machine learning methods. We discuss their advantages and current limitations in different scenarios. We outline how therapeutic decision-making can be aided by mathematical and computational approaches and how patient-specific responses can be assessed and incorporated into such methods. We also survey models that can incorporate adaptive changes throughout the course of treatment and discuss data and parameter estimation approaches. Finally, we highlight how such methods can lead to the identification of optimum treatment options for individual cancer and treatment types, and examine the challenges that remain to be addressed to enable the clinical translation of computational models in cancer therapy.},

	abstract = {Dosage optimization to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity is a potential issue when administering radiotherapy (RT) in combination with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) or inhibitors of the DNA Damage Response Pathway (DDRi) in the clinic. Preclinical models and mathematical modeling can help identify ideal dosage schedules to observe beneficial effects of a tri-therapy. The aim of this study is to describe a mathematical model to capture the impact of RT in combination with inhibitors of the DNA Damage Response Pathway or blockade of the immune checkpoint protein – programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). This model describes how RT mediated activation of antigen presenting cells can induce an increase in cytolytic T cells capable of targeting tumor cells, and how combination drugs can potentiate the immune response by inhibiting the rate of T cell exhaustion. The model was fitted using preclinical data, where MC38 tumors were treated in vivo with RT alone or in combination with anti-PD-L1 as well as with either olaparib or the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) inhibitor—AZD0156. The model successfully described the observed data and goodness-of-fit, using visual predictive checks also confirmed a successful internal model validation for each treatment modality. The results demonstrated that the anti-PD-L1 effect in combination with RT was maximal in vivo and any additional benefit of DDRi at the given dosage and schedule used was undetectable. Model fit results indicated AZD0156 to be a more potent DDRi than olaparib. Simulations of alternative doses indicated that reducing efficacy of anti-PD-L1 by 68\% would potentially provide evidence for a benefit of ATM inhibition in combination with ICB and increase the relative efficacy of tri-therapy.},

We present a number of examples of graphical models, including the QMR-DT database, the sigmoid belief network, the Boltzmann machine, and several variants of hidden Markov models, in which it is infeasible to run exact inference algorithms. We then introduce variational methods, which exploit laws of large numbers to transform the original graphical model into a simplified graphical model in which inference is efficient. Inference in the simpified model provides bounds on probabilities of interest in the original model. We describe a general framework for generating variational transformations based on convex duality. Finally we return to the examples and demonstrate how variational algorithms can be formulated in each case.},

	abstract = {A quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model of the pathogenesis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection can streamline and accelerate the development of novel medicines to treat COVID-19. Simulation of clinical trials allows in silico exploration of the uncertainties of clinical trial design and can rapidly inform their protocols. We previously published a preliminary model of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. To further our understanding of COVID-19 and treatment, we significantly updated the model by matching a curated dataset spanning viral load and immune responses in plasma and lung. We identified a population of parameter sets to generate heterogeneity in pathophysiology and treatment and tested this model against published reports from interventional SARS-CoV-2 targeting mAb and antiviral trials. Upon generation and selection of a virtual population, we match both the placebo and treated responses in viral load in these trials. We extended the model to predict the rate of hospitalization or death within a population. Via comparison of the in silico predictions with clinical data, we hypothesize that the immune response to virus is log-linear over a wide range of viral load. To validate this approach, we show the model matches a published subgroup analysis, sorted by baseline viral load, of patients treated with neutralizing Abs. By simulating intervention at different time points post infection, the model predicts efficacy is not sensitive to interventions within five days of symptom onset, but efficacy is dramatically reduced if more than five days pass post symptom onset prior to treatment.},

	abstract = {p53, encoded by the tumor suppressor gene TP53, is one of the most important tumor suppressor factors in vivo and can be negatively regulated by MDM2 through p53–MDM2 negative feedback loop. Abnormal p53 can be observed in almost all tumors, mainly including p53 mutation and functional inactivation. Blocking MDM2 to restore p53 function is a hotspot in the development of anticancer candidates. Till now, nine MDM2 inhibitors with different structural types have entered clinical trials. However, no MDM2 inhibitor has been approved for clinical application. This review focused on the discovery, structural modification, preclinical and clinical research of the above compounds from the perspective of medicinal chemistry. Based on this, the possible defects in MDM2 inhibitors in clinical development were analyzed to suggest that the multitarget strategy or targeted degradation strategy based on MDM2 has the potential to reduce the dose-dependent hematological toxicity of MDM2 inhibitors and improve their anti-tumor activity, providing certain guidance for the development of agents targeting the p53–MDM2 interaction.},

Automatic differentiation is a powerful tool to automate the calculation of derivatives and is preferable to more traditional methods, especially when differentiating complex algorithms and mathematical functions. The implementation of automatic differentiation however requires some care to insure efficiency. Modern differentiation packages deploy a broad range of computational techniques to improve applicability, run time, and memory management. Among these techniques are operation overloading, region based memory, and expression templates. There also exist several mathematical techniques which can yield high performance gains when applied to complex algorithms. For example, semi-analytical derivatives can reduce by orders of magnitude the runtime required to numerically solve and differentiate an algebraic equation. Open problems include the extension of current packages to provide more specialized routines, and efficient methods to perform higher-order differentiation.},

	abstract = {The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway plays a crucial role in various cellular processes and is aberrantly activated in cancers, contributing to the occurrence and progression of tumors. Examining the upstream and downstream nodes of this pathway could allow full elucidation of its function. Based on accumulating evidence, strategies targeting major components of the pathway might provide new insights for cancer drug discovery. Researchers have explored the use of some inhibitors targeting this pathway to block survival pathways. However, because oncogenic PI3K pathway activation occurs through various mechanisms, the clinical efficacies of these inhibitors are limited. Moreover, pathway activation is accompanied by the development of therapeutic resistance. Therefore, strategies involving pathway inhibitors and other cancer treatments in combination might solve the therapeutic dilemma. In this review, we discuss the roles of the PI3K/Akt pathway in various cancer phenotypes, review the current statuses of different PI3K/Akt inhibitors, and introduce combination therapies consisting of signaling inhibitors and conventional cancer therapies. The information presented herein suggests that cascading inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, either alone or in combination with other therapies, are the most effective treatment strategy for cancer.},
